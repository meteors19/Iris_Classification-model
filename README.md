# Iris_Classification-model

Just built a Iris Flower Classification model, a classic starter project that uses flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) to classify Iris species. This “Hello World” of classification problems helped me understand key ML concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpreting results.
What I learned:
1)Loading and exploring datasets with Pandas
2)Handling feature selection and label encoding
3)Implementing classifiers like Logistic Regression & Decision Trees
4)Evaluating model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports
This project was a great introduction to machine learning pipelines and has motivated me to tackle more complex models and real-world datasets.
If you’re starting out or curious about ML, I highly recommend the Iris dataset as a hands-on way to learn the fundamentals!
